# UserManagement

### I created an ASP.NET core 6 Web API, and an Angular project.

### To run the project you can run the Web API using Visual studio.

### To run the angular project you can go to the directory of the project and run the website using ng serve.

### After the project is running, you will see a login screen, if you do not have an account youcan easily navigate to register then login.

### Feel free to ask me questions: rrabelani7@gmail.com
